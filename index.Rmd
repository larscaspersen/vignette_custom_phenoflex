## Hi and welcome, fellow phenology modellers and aspiring ones!

This website compiles various ways to customize **PhenoFlex** to better suit your needs. I am [Lars Caspersen](https://www.gartenbauwissenschaften.uni-bonn.de/en/staff/lars-caspersen), a a PhD student in the [HortiBonn group](https://www.gartenbauwissenschaften.uni-bonn.de/en) at the University of Bonn, Germany, where my research focuses on phenology modeling. 

During my PhD, I primarily worked with **PhenoFlex** [@luedeling_phenoflex_2021], available through the **chillR** package [@luedeling_chillr_2023]. Along the way, I was asked to document my experiences, share what I learned, and what tools I created - so this website was born!

To support collaboration and make my workflow more accessible, I bundled my custom functions into two R packages: 

- [LarsChill](https://github.com/larscaspersen/addition_chillR) - a collection of general-purpose functions that complement **chillR** (Yes, naming things is not my strongest skill üòÖ)
- [evalpheno](https://github.com/larscaspersen/eval_phenoflex) - focused on functions to calculate bloom dates, especially helpful during PhenoFlex calibration. 

These packages are currently available via GitHub only (not CRAN). Over time, some of their features may be integrated into our main package, [chillR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chillR/index.html).

This site serves as a hub for all the tweaks, adaptations, and custom versions of **PhenoFlex** I developed through my PhD. I hope it proves useful for others working in this field ‚Äî whether you're new to PhenoFlex or looking to explore it more deeply.

If you run into any issues, have questions, or just want to connect, don't hesitate to reach  out! You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/larscaspersen/vignette_custom_phenoflex) or email me (or my supervisor Eike Luedeling). Details are on the left-hand side of the page. 

 ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This collection of vignettes is *not* a  general introduction to PhenoFlex. For that, please check out:
 
- The [official PhenoFlex vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chillR/vignettes/PhenoFlex.html)
- The course book: [Tree phenology analysis with R](https://inresgb-lehre.iaas.uni-bonn.de/chillR_book/introduction.html)
- And, of course, the [PhenoFlex publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016819232100174X).

I learned a lot about building websites like this from Jaqueline Wingen's learning logbook, created during the *Tree Phenology Analysis with R* course. Check out her amazing site: <https://jacqwng.github.io/Tree-phenology-analysis-with-R/index.html>
