	abstract = {The Dynamic model has been described as one of the most accurate models to quantify chill accumulation based on hourly temperatures in nuts and temperate fruits. This model considers that a dynamic process occurs at a biochemical level that determines the endodormancy breaking through the accumulation of the so-called portions. The kinetic parameters present in the model should reflect how the fruit trees integrate chilling exposure and thus they should be characteristic for each species. However, the original parameter values, reported in the late 1980s, are still being used. Even if the use of such parameter values is useful to compare among chilling requirements (CRs) for different species or cultivars, it is not the optimal choice when one intends to explain the CR variations in different years for a given cultivar. In this work we propose a data-based model calibration that makes use of phenological data for different apricot cultivars within different years to obtain model parameters, which minimize the variations among years and that have, at the same time, physical meaning to characterize the incumbent species. Results reveal that the estimation not only reduces the accumulated portion dispersion within the considered time periods but also allows to improve the CR predictions for subsequent years. We propose a set of model parameter values to predict endodormancy breaking dates in the apricot cultivars studied here.},

	abstract = {A two-step model describing the thermal dependence of the dormancy breaking phenomenon is developed. The model assumes that the level of dormancy completion is proportional to the amount of a certain dormancy breaking factor which accumulates in plants by a two-step process. The first step represents a reversible process of formation of a precursor for the dormancy breaking factor at low temperatures and its destruction at high temperatures. The rate constants of this process are assumed to be dependent upon the temperature according to the Arrhenius law. The second step is an irreversible cooperative transition from the unstable precursor to a stable dormancy breaking factor. The transition is assumed to occur when a critical level of the precursor is accumulated. The two-step scheme is analysed mathematically. This model explains qualitatively the main observations on dormancy completion made under controlled temperature conditions and relates the parameters of the theory to the measurable characteristics of the system.},

	abstract = {Forecasting spring phenology of temperate fruit trees is of high concern for orchard plannersand fruit producers, particularly in the context of climate change. Responding to this need, horticultural researchers have developed models to estimate chill and heat requirements and project dormancy release. Despite some successes in dormancy modeling, several shortcomings still hamper reliable forecasts. Many widely used models rely on oversimplified and inflexible assumptions and are neither validated nor parameterized for most species or cul­ tivars. More complex models are often poorly accessible due to a lack of guidance on calibration and application. Moreover, most approaches do not provide estimates of uncertainty. We aimed to develop a dormancy model that (a) is based on the best available biological understanding and experimental evidence on dormancy dy­ namics, (b) can flexibly adapt to species- and cultivar-specific physiology, (c) comes with a detailed description of the work-flow and (d) is open-source. The result is the new modeling framework PhenoFlex. It combines the Dynamic Model for chill accumulation with the Growing-Degree-Hours model for heat accumulation by a flexible transition. PhenoFlex is accompanied by a framework for calibrating the 12 model parameters. It is published as part of the chillR package, which contains a detailed vignette. We tested the predictive performance of PhenoFlex with 60 years of apple and pear bloom data and compared results to several benchmark models. With Root Mean Square Error values for projected bloom dates of 4.0 days for pears and 3.8 days for apples, PhenoFlex out­ performed all other models including the StepChill model (10.2 and 7.7 days, respectively), and a machine learning approach (5.6 and 6.3 days). Some temperature response dynamics appeared unrealistic, indicating the need for larger training datasets with more temperature variation. We hope that PhenoFlex will facilitate further research on the temperature response dynamics of temperate tree species.},

	abstract = {Phenology models are crucial tools for assessing climate change impacts in forestry, ecology and agriculture. Such models are typically calibrated with observational or experimental data and validated with a set of inde­ pendent observations. While there have been extensive discussions about validation approaches, systematic studies assessing the effects of the calibration data on the predictive performance of the fitted model are scarce. We evaluated the impact of marginal seasons in the calibration data set on the predictive power of an integrated modeling framework (PhenoFlex) that was recently proposed to predict spring phenology in temperate trees. We calibrated PhenoFlex with phenology records of apple trees from a multi-season experiment (59 experimental seasons) that included five unusually warm winter seasons. For comparison, we excluded these marginal seasons in a second version of the analysis. We fitted the 12 model parameters to data, assessed model performance using a common validation data set and evaluated the chill and heat responses during dormancy for both versions. Despite high overall accuracy, our results indicated a better model performance (Root Mean Square Errors of 2.3 versus 5.5 days) when excluding the marginal seasons. We observed a similar shape for the chill response curve across versions but a greater chill effectiveness when including the marginal seasons. Fitted parameters suggest a hard drop in heat efficiency beyond the optimum temperature when including the marginal seasons, probably highlighting the need for more moderate conditions during model calibration. Our results demonstrate a good performance of PhenoFlex when calibration and validation data were comparable, but they also indicate risks involved in using the framework to project phenology under conditions that differ strongly from those used for calibration. Further evaluation and validation under experimentally or naturally occurring warm conditions may improve our understanding of the response of temperate trees to mild winter conditions.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to impact fruit tree bloom dates, including delayed bloom or bloom failure, especially where warming winters reduce the accumulation of winter chill, which is needed to overcome dormancy. Modeling fruit tree bloom is challenging, as the mechanisms of chill and heat accumulation are not well understood, and progress through the dormancy period is difficult to monitor. We fitted the processbased phenology model PhenoFlex to long-term observations (1948-2008; 1984-2008, depending on cultivar and location) of the 10\% bloom dates of three almond (Prunus dulcis) cultivars (‘Mission’, ‘Nonpareil’ and ‘Sonora’) in two locations (Chico and Modesto) in the Central Valley of California. Using a weather generator and climate scenarios produced by seven climate models included in the CMIP6 model intercomparison project, we generated plausible weather scenarios for current conditions and for an ensemble of future climate scenarios, focusing on two points in time (2050, 2085) and four future greenhouse gas emission scenarios based on four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585). PhenoFlex adequately captured the dynamics of 10\% almond bloom, with a root mean square error of 2.7-4.4 days for calibration (34-49 observations) and 4.0-5.3 days for validation (15-22 observations). Comparison of historic and future simulated bloom dates showed that the median bloom dates of ‘Mission’ remained unchanged compared to the baseline, whereas ‘Sonora’ and ‘Nonpareil’ showed slightly later bloom dates (12 days) in the near future. In the more distant future and under pessimistic warming scenarios, ‘Mission’ and ‘Sonora’ bloom was delayed by 6-14 days on average, with ‘Mission’ occasionally exhibiting strong delays by up to 30 days. Given the need for pollinizer-cultivar overlap in most almond production, this work demonstrates that the cultivar-specific response of bloom to climate change could pose a risk to production that warrants strong consideration.},
