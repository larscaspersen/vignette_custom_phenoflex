This section focuses on calibrating **PhenoFlex**. The function `chillR::phenologyFitter()` is a great starting point for estimating model parameters. However, it may not always be the perfect fit for your specific use case. For example, you might want to:
 
 - [Keep certain model parameters fixed](fixing-parameters-before-calibration.html)
 - [Use a different global optimization algorithm](implement-meigo.html)
 - [Replace parameters with intermediate, more narrowly defined ones](intermediate-model-parameters.html)
 - Introduce additional parameters to the model
 - Share (or *pool*) parameters across cultivars of the same species
 - Or even model a sequence of phenological events within a single framework
 
 This page brings together a variety of customizations you might consider when calibrating **PhenoFlex**
